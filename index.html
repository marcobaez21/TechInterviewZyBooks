      Given the points (1, 2) and (5, 10) to find the slope we must complete the following steps:
      <ul>
        <li>Plug in the points to this equation: (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)</li>
        <li>Doing so gives us this (10-2)/(5-1)</li>
        <li>Simplifying (10-2)/(5-1) gives us a slope of 2</li>
      </ul>
      Given the points (1, 2) and (5, 10) with a slope of 2 to find the Y-intercept we must complete the following steps:
      <ul>
        <li>Plug in one of the given points and the slope to the equation y=mx+b where m is the slope and b is the Y-intercept</li>
        <li>Plugging in the point (1, 2) and the slope of 2 results in 2=2x1+b</li>
        <li>Simplifying 2=2x1+b results in b=0 or a Y-intercept of 0</li>
      </ul>

      Given the points (2, 2) and (4, 3) to find the slope graphically we must complete the following steps, as seen above:
      <ul>
        <li>Plot both points and draw a line connecting both of them</li>
        <li>Count the x value's distance between the two points, in this case it is 2</li>
        <li>Count the y value's distance between the two points, in this case it is 1</li>
        <li>Plugging into the equation m = Δy / Δx gives a slope of 1/2</li>
      </ul>
      Given the points (2, 2) and (4, 3) to find the Y-Intercept graphically we must complete the following steps, as seen above:
      <ul>
        <li>Plot both points and draw a line connecting both of them</li>
        <li>Continue drawing this line until the line hits the Y axis</li>
        <li>The point where the line hits the Y axis is the Y-Intercept. In this case it is 1</li>
      </ul>
